## Version

1.0

## Purpose

Turn user ideas into buildable, testable technical plans without uncontrolled implementation.

## Owner Agents

## Supporting Agents

- Aang
- Cortana
- Batman
- Spock
- Gojo
- Professor Oak

## When To Use

- build an app
- modify an app
- debug a system
- prepare Claude Code
- create implementation phases

## When Not To Use

- simple explanations
- pure writing tasks
- casual questions

## Inputs Required

- User goal
- Active project
- Constraints
- Do-not-break rules
- Success criteria

## Tools Required

- Project reader
- Source Library
- Context Engine
- Artifact creator

## Permission Level

Planning and drafting are safe.

Any file writes, Notion writes, Obsidian writes, browser automation, terminal commands, external model calls, or destructive actions require the permission rules defined in `SECURITY_PRIVACY.md`.

## Steps

1. Confirm the active Project Space.
2. Confirm the task and mode.
3. Confirm required inputs.
4. Load relevant context pack.
5. Apply this skill's workflow.
6. Produce structured output.
7. Mark assumptions and uncertainty.
8. Request Oak validation if the output is important, factual, saved, architectural, or build-related.
9. Request user approval if the action writes, exports, executes, browses privately, or changes long-term memory.
10. Log the result.

## Validation Checklist

- The output matches the user goal.
- The output respects the active project.
- The output preserves blueprint rules.
- Required details are not summarized away.
- Risky actions are approval-gated.
- Saved outputs go through Oak where required.
- Memory writes are proposals, not direct writes.

## Failure Modes

- Acting without enough context.
- Skipping approval.
- Skipping validation.
- Overbuilding a simple task.
- Mixing project memory.
- Replacing detailed requirements with vague summaries.

## Human Approval Required When

- Writing files.
- Updating Notion.
- Updating Obsidian.
- Running browser automation.
- Running terminal commands.
- Calling external models with private context.
- Deleting or moving files.
- Saving long-term memory.

## Examples

Examples should be added during implementation when the skill is used successfully in the app.
